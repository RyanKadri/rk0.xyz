## Class 2

- Rather than teaching styles first and CSS second, what if I taught CSS syntax first and inline styles as an afterthought?
- For quiz 2, remember to instruct students not to change the HTML

## JS

- JS is not Java
- Cover different for-loops early. Hammer home for-each
- Really hammer in what parameters are all about
- Emphasize console as sandbox

## Lab 4

- Switch out Palindrome question (too much copying)
- Maybe allow students to add inputs of their own (get confused by list of inputs)
- Loading spinner + debounce to know something happened
- Really stress the difference between solving for the inputs and solving generally

## Lab 3

- Be careful to specifically call out multi-column view & no background color
- Call out that you want 9 images for the breakpoints part

## Midterm

- Be careful about super unambiguous wording
- List problems must give sort order

## Quizzes

- Explain terminology -- Print == console.log
- Explicitly say when you don't need code
