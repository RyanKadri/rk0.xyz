- Thinking about functions x5
    - How would you explain this task to an alien or a friend with no common sense
    - Grow the problem. Is your solution more structured?
    - Rules of thumb
        - Loops:
            - How many...?
            - Find the...?
            - Create a list...?
        - For loops:
            - Is there an array and you have to do some task that looks at all (or many) elements?
            - Is there a string and you have to look at all the letters?
            - Do you have to repeat a task N times?
        - While loops:
            - Are you trying to find the first N of something?
            - Does some special condition let you know you're done?
        - If conditions:
            - Does your function have a set of rules to follow to determine the right answer?
            - Do you need to "check" something in the
            - Does your function have a fixed set of different outcomes?
            - When describing the task in english, do you use the word "if" a lot?
- JavaScript Array methods x4
    - Know how to access elements of an array by position
    - Arrays start at 0. Not 1
    - To get the last item, `arr[arr.length-1]`
    - `.push` to add items to the end
    - `arr[i] = xyz` to update the array's ith position to xyz
- Loops x7
    - `for(let i = 0; i < 10; i++) { ... }`
    - `for(const element of arr) { ... }`
    - For-of when you have an array (unless you need to update items "in-place")
- Conditions x2
    - Know how to chain up "else if"'s
    - `if(something) { ... } else if (somethingElse) { ... } else { ... }`
- Strings x2
    - Strings represent text
    - Can concatenate together, convert to uppercase, etc
- console.log vs return x3
    - The console is a place for you to debug and test your code. Not super useful for your users
    - 95% of the time, return a value
    - If you ask for your grade and I write it in my notebook but never actually tell you, that's console.log()
    - Telling you the result is like return
- Lab 4 x3
- JavaScript inputs x2
- Using JS in HTML x3
- Overall syntax
    - Remember your parentheses and curly brackets
    - Indentation is not required but helps
    - Returns end a function

- CSS Layout (grid / flex) x9
- Responsive Design x4
- CSS Positioning
- Media queries
- Margins / Padding / Borders
- Specificity

- Popular HTML Tags
- Debugging
- Terminology
- DOM
- Resources
- Format of midterm


- CSS Frameworks (only need to know what they are. Not exact details)
- Regex will not be on the midterm (may revisit)


## Problems
- Find the max from an array
- Map an array
- Interleave arrays
- Secret Code
- Product of digits - Sum of Digits
- Sum of Multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000
- Print fibonacci numbers?

## Midterm
- I will give 3 hours (in order to not have a super painful test)
- Will be open book
- Available all day but time-limited
- Some long answer concepts
- Some HTML "make this thing"
- Some JavaScript "write this function"
- Probably some short answer
- All quiz answers are posted
