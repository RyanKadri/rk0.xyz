    explanation: `For this problem, I will pass an array to your function. Please return the sum of all the prime numbers in the array. Remember that a prime number is a number that is not divisible by any number other than itself and 1. You probably want to break this function into two parts. For the first part, can you write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the sum? Can you write a function that checks if a number is prime? How can you combine these two functions together to come up with the desired result?`,
    code: `function sumOfPrimes(numbers) {
    // Find the sum. Maybe call isPrime somewhere to help
}
