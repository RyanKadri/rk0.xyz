# Exercise: HTTP Guessing Game

For this exercise, I want you to create a simple HTTP API for a guessing game using Spring. Your API should have two endpoints:

## Setting the Secret Number

If the user makes a POST request to `http://localhost:8080/set`, with a body of:
```javascript
{
    "value": 123
}
```
the server will store 123 as a "secret number"

## Guessing the Secret Number

If the user makes a GET request to `http://localhost:8080/guess/{number}` with `{ number }` replaced by the number they want to guess, the server will let them know if they guessed the secret number correctly.

If the user guessed correctly, the server should respond with:

```javascript
{
    "result": "Yay! You win!"
}
```

If the user guessed incorrectly, the result message should either say `"Too high :("` or `"Too low :("`.

If the user guesses before the secret number was set, your server should return an error response.
