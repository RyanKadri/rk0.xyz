# Practicum in Software Construction - Midterm Study Guide

## Midterm Format

The midterm will be administered through Canvas on Wednesday February 23rd. It will be available all day but you will have **3 hours** to complete the exam once you start. It is open book and open computer but all work must be completed independently. It will contain a mix of freeform concept questions, "find the bug" type problems, and a couple short coding exercises.

## What is not on the test?

- We only brushed over Cucumber so I won't ask you to write Cucumber tests. The *concept* of Behavior Driven Development is fair game though
- I'm not expecting you to know any specific open source licenses.
- Art History will not be on the Midterm
- Feel free to ask if anything else will definitely not be on the Midterm

## Tips

- Get good at setting up a setting up a basic Spring project in your IDE. Maybe set up one ahead of time. Don't waste time futzing with IDE settings.
- Make sure you know how to start a Spring server how to test your @GetMapping / @PostMapping / etc methods. If you haven't figured out Postman or a similar tool yet, now is the time.
- Make sure you know how to include a new library in your project from Maven
