# Lab 7: The One Where You Make a Pokedex

## Overview

In this lab, you will be making a web application that fetches and displays information about PokÃ©men based on user input. The user will have an option to search for a PokÃ©man by name and then, based on the information that shows up, will have the option to dig further into specifics about their attacks / stats. This will give you a chance to build an HTML page with a common template but whose data changes based on user input. For the last part of the lab, you will also make your first request to an external API for data about any pokemon

## Part 1: Displaying Data

For the first part of this lab, you will be building a web page that displays information about the Pokemon "Charmander". The page should show the following information about Charmander with the appropriate labels:

- Name
- An image of the Pokemon
- Height
- Weight
- Type(s)
- Starting Stats (in a table)

Rather than hardcoding this information into a static website though, the data about Charmander will be provided in a JavaScript object (actually an array of objects but we'll get to that). It will be your job to use JavaScript to take each of the data fields from the Charmander object and display it on the page.

Here's the JavaScript that defines a few different Pokemon as objects in an array. Please copy this code exactly into a `.js` file and use it as a starting point for your project.

```js
const pokemon = [
    { 
        name: "charmander", 
        height: 6, 
        weight: 85, 
        sprites: {
            front_default: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/4.png"
        },
        stats: [
            {
                base_stat: 39,
                effort: 0,
                stat: {
                    name: "hp",
                    url: "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/stat/1/"
                }
            },
                {
                base_stat: 52,
                effort: 0,
                stat: {
                    name: "attack",
                    url: "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/stat/2/"
                }
            },
                {

                    url: "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/stat/3/"
                }
            },
            {
                base_stat: 60,
                effort: 0,

                }

                }

    },

                effort: 0,
                stat: {

                }
            },
            {
                base_stat: 65,

                stat: {
                    name: "defense",
                    url: "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/stat/3/"
                }

                }

            {
                base_stat: 64,
                effort: 0,
                stat: {
                    name: "special-defense",
                    url: "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/stat/5/"
                }

            {
                base_stat: 43,

                stat: {
                    name: "speed",
                    url: "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/stat/6/"
                }
            }
        ],
        types: [
            {
                slot: 1,
                type: {
                    name: "water"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
]
```

This code creates a single variable that holds data about 2 pokemon. If you had to store all of the information about all pokemon, you could probably guess that this variable declaration would be pretty big! For now, I'd suggest putting the pokemon data in a separate file on its own. Your code for this part of the lab can live in its own file. Remember to put the data definition file first so that your other site code can read the data.

Your job for this part of the lab will be to read the first pokemon object (charmander) out of the data array and displaying the data fields mentioned above.

## Part 2: Searching for a Pokemon

For this part of the lab, please create a text box and a button at the top of your page. Users should be able to enter a pokemon's name and click the button to search for information about that pokemon. When they click the button, please use a JavaScript function to figure out which pokemon from the data array in part 1 they are searching for. Right now there are only 3 options but in Part 3 we will extend that to include **all** of the pokemon.

When you figure out which JavaScript object they searched for from the data array, please display the corresponding information about **that** Pokemon instead of the Pokemon that had been displaying. You might want to update your code from Part 1 so that you can use the same code to display information about any pokemon in the data array instead of only working for Charmander. 

If the user looks up a Pokemon that does not exist in the data array from Part 1, please display an error message to say that the Pokemon the user searched did not exist in the database.

## Part 3: Looking up Pokemon with an API

*If you've gotten to this point in the lab before class on 11/3, you will run into some concepts that we haven't covered yet. Feel free to give this part a try but if you have trouble, you may want to wait until the 3rd*

In this part of the lab, you will be setting up your page to ask an external server for information about the pokemon that the user searched for. This is nice because your webpage code does not need to have hardcoded information about every Pokemon in it. To request this information from the server, you should use the `fetch` function. The API that you should request information from is located at https://pokeapi.co/. On the main landing page, there is an example of the kind of request you should make. For instance, if the user searches for Charmander, you would make a GET request for the URL https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/charmander

That request will return way more information about Charmander than we had hardcoded into the data array. That's not a problem though. All of the information that we hardcoded in the data array is still there in the API response in exactly the same format. That means if you can take the response from the API and pass it into your code that displays the Pokemon data, your site should just work.

In other words, for this part of the lab, you should update your page so that when a user searches for a Pokemon, the page calls the Pokedex API with a URL based on what pokemon was searched. The response from the API should contain all of the same data that was previously hardcoded so you should be able to just use THAT data to update your page instead of what was in the data array.

Congrats! When this part is done, you will have created a Pokedex webpage that can look up information about any Pokemon. And you didn't even need to research any Pokemon data yourself.

## Submitting

As usual, please upload your submission to the appropriate Canvas assignment as a zip file. Your zip file should include any HTML, CSS and JavaScript you wrote to complete the lab
